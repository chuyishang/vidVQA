EXPLANATION: This question asks about the actions of the baby after throwing the green cup away near the end of the video. Since we are currently at 13 seconds out of 30 seconds, we are close to the middle of the video, and the question asks about an action near the end, we need to move forward in the video to find the frame where the baby throws the green cup away. Once we find that frame, we need to go to the frame after to see what the baby does next. After that, we need to describe the scene in more detail to provide more information to answer the question.

Currently, we are at 23.0 seconds in a 47.36666666666667 seconds video, so to gather more information about the lady's action while turning back, we need to find a frame where she is likely turning back. If we calculate the midpoint of the video, we get 47.36666666666667/2 = 23.683333333333335. Given this, we decide to go to the 24th second as it is closest to the midpoint and empirically the default choice in such cases.
