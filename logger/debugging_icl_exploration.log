What is the white dog doing after going to the cushion?'], EXPLANATION: The next step in the plan is to move to the frame after the white dog goes to the cushion. First, we need to find the frame when the white dog goes to the cushion. Since we are currently at 43.03 seconds out of 62.73 seconds, we need to proceed further to see the action of the white dog after going to the cushion. We can move forward or backward by half of the remaining time, so we choose to go to the 53rd second. Then, we should ask what the white dog does after going to the cushion to fulfill the plan.

EXPLANATION: The current frame is at 60.4 seconds of an 89.97 seconds video.

The video length is 89.96666666666667 seconds, so we are already close to the end. Moving forward from the current frame makes the most sense.

This means that we have found the frame where the girl in white is bending down. Thus, we can modify our plan to remove the step we have completed.

We know that currently we are at the 3.33 second mark in a 35.7 second video. The middle of the video is at 35.7/2 = 17.85 seconds, and we are currently at 3.33s, which is before the middle. Consequently, to find the frame after she bends down, we should go to the 17.85 second mark which is the middle of the video. Then, we can describe the scene around the girl in white in detail.

EXPLANATION: The question asks about the action of a man in white after moving forward at the start of the video. Since this is a temporal question, we need to find the frame where the man in white is moving forward and then locate the frame after this action.

Now, we need to move to the frame after he is moving forward. In this example, we can move forward by performing frame splitting. Since there are no other frames in info, we can move to the frame in between the current frame and the end, which is (27.5 - 0.06666666666666667)/2 = 13.766666666666666 seconds.

The first step in the plan is to find the frame where the man in white is moving forward at the start. Since the video is 27.5 seconds long and we are currently at 13.766666666666666 seconds, which is nearly the middle, we should move back in time to find the start.

EXPLANATION: The question asks about an action that happens after the man in white moves forward at the start. However, the current frames we have observed show different actions of the man in white, including holding a tennis racket, bending over to pick up a bottle, and looking at something on the ground. As the actions of the man in white vary across the observed frames, we need to continue observing more frames to gain a comprehensive understanding of the action the man takes after moving forward. Then, we can describe the scene in detail to provide more information to answer the question accurately. Also, we need to identify the specific action taken after moving forward, so we should modify our plan to look for the exact moment after the man moves forward and observe the action at that specific frame.

EXPLANATION: Since our question is about the man in white and his action after moving forward at the start, we need to find the specific frame where the man in white moves forward. Since the image captioning module only provides a general description of the scene, we need to gain more specific information about the action of the man in white. Since we are at the start of the video, we need to move forward in the video to locate the action and then describe the scene in detail to gather more information.

The plan is to find out what the man in white does after moving forward at the beginning. To execute the plan, we need to first move to the frames where the man in white moves forward. As the current frame is close to the start, we should move to 5 seconds to see if the man in white is moving forward and what action he takes. The most straightforward question to fulfill this step is to ask if there is a man in white moving forward. Thus, the output will be to go to the 5 second mark and ask if there is a man in white moving forward.

We're currently at the 26.4415-second mark in a 62.733333333333334-second video. To fulfill the plan, we should move to a frame shortly after the 26.4415-second mark, so we choose the 30-second mark. Then, we can ask what the white dog is doing after approaching the cushion.

EXPLANATION: From the info, we have found the frames where the baby is letting go of the cart and where the baby is doing something after letting go of the cart. Our plan already includes these steps, so we can keep the same plan. However, we need to ensure we have enough information to identify the specific action the baby is doing after letting go of the cart. We will modify the plan to focus on the specific action taken after the baby lets go of the cart.

EXPLANATION: The description and action on the current frame indicate that the baby is playing with a surface or a toy, rather than letting go of a cart. Therefore, we need to go forward in the video to find the frame where the baby lets go of the cart. Once we identify this frame, we can focus on describing the action of the baby in detail to understand what the baby does after letting go of the cart.

As the next available frame is at 42.018 seconds, and the total length is 50.766666666666666 seconds, we can move forward by performing frame splitting.

INFO:root:PLAN: ['We need to find the frame where the man in white moves forward at the start.', 'We need to describe the action of the man in white after he moves forward.']
EXPLANATION: The current frame does not show the action of the man in white moving forward at the start, but rather depicts a scene of a group of people gathered in a room. Thus, our first step involves finding the frame where the man in white moves forward at the start to understand his action. Then, we need to describe the action of the man in white after he moves forward to collect more information about the scene. While the current frame and info do not provide immediate answers to our question, with the plan described, we can take steps to find the answers.

Since the video has not yet progressed, we should go to a frame near the start of the video, perhaps at 2 seconds out of 27.5 seconds. Then, after identifying the action of the man in white after moving forward, we can describe it. The simplest question to ask to fulfill the plan is 'What is the man in white doing after moving forward?'

Since we have a specific action to identify, we should focus on a frame after the white dog goes to the cushion. We are currently on the 43.03333333333333 second mark of a 62.733333333333334 second video, so moving forward by a second leads us to the 44.03333333333333 second mark.

As we are currently at the 8.67 second mark in a 50.77 second video, we need to move forward to find the frame where the baby is letting go of the cart. Since we need to keep track of where we are in the video to effectively find the right frame to move to, the simplest question to ask to fulfill the plan is 'Is the baby letting go of the cart?'. We can move forward by performing frame splitting. Since there are no other frames in INFO, we can move to the frame in between the current frame and the end, which is (8.67 + 50.77) / 2 = 29.72 seconds. Thus, we should go to the 29.72 second mark.

INFO:root:Explanation: There is not enough information to answer the question. While we know there is a man in white, the info about him states that he is holding a baseball bat and leaning on it, bending down to pick up a small child, and holding a pool cue. None of these actions align closely with the answer choices provided. We need more specific details about the actions of the man in white after moving forward to make a choice. Therefore, the answer is None.

INFO:root:PLAN: ['Identify the frames showing the man in white moving forward.', 'Move to the frames after the man in white is moving forward.', 'Describe the scenes around the man in white in detail.']
EXPLANATION: Our question asks about the actions of a man in white after moving forward at the start. Our past plan is designed to identify the frame specifically showing the man in white moving forward. The current info contains multiple instances of the man in white, each showing different actions. We need to update our plan to ensure we capture all instances after the man in white moves forward and describe the scenes to gather detailed information.

INFO:root:NEW TIME: 14.0, NEW FRAME: ([420], <PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=640x480 at 0x7FE9C4012F10>), NEW QUESTIONS: ['Is there a man in white? What is the man in white doing after moving forward?'], EXPLANATION: The plan asks us to find the frames where the man in white is moving forward at the start to identify what he does after. We have information about a few frames after the start but don't have a frame specifically after the man in white moves forward. We currently are at the 0.5s mark. We need to move to the frames after the man in white moves forward, but we don't have that specific information. Therefore we should explore the frames by moving forward by performing frame splitting. Since there are no other frames, we can move to the frame in between the current frame and the end, which is (0.5 + 27.5) / 2 = 14.0 seconds. Thus, we should go to the 14.0 second mark.
