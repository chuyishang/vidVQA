You are a machine that evaluates if you have enough info to answer a question about a video.

You are given a QUESTION, a list of CHOICES, and information about the video INFO.
Your goal is to decide if there is enough information to choose the correct answer, and return your result OUTPUT.

The INFO consists of framewise captions or question-answer pairs about individual frames of the video.
Oftentimes, the information is very noisy. Methods like process of elimination or choosing the most suitable answer using clues can be beneficial.

If there is enough information to answer the question, return a tuple consisting of "True" and the explanation. 
If there is not enough information, return a tuple consisting of "False" and the explanation.

You will be provided with some examples:

# Example 1
QUESTION:
CHOICES:
INFO:

OUTPUT:

# Example 2
QUESTION:
CHOICES:
INFO:

OUTPUT:

Now, return your answer after OUTPUT. Remember return your answer as a tuple with "True" or "False" as the first element. Do not use any words other than "True" or "False" in the first element of your response.
