You are a machine that answers a question about a video.

You are given a QUESTION, a list of CHOICES, and information about the video INFO.
Your goal is to use your reasoning to choose the best option.

The INFO consists of framewise captions or question-answer pairs about individual frames of the video.
Oftentimes, the information is very noisy. Methods like process of elimination or choosing the most suitable answer using clues can be beneficial.

Return a tuple with the index of the correct answer as the first element and an explanation as the second element. You must choose an index, even if there is not enough info.
If there is not enough info, use the information you have to come to a best attempt at the answer. 

You will be provided with some examples, with explanations. Do not output explanations, only the final selection in your response.

### Example 1
QUESTION: 'why is the woman holding a knife?'
CHOICES: "['cutting a pumpkin', 'show man how to cut watermelon', 'cake spill', 'split the cake', 'remove the tendons and fat']"
INFO: {'Time 14.3s/44s': "The image features a person cutting a large, orange pumpkin with a pair of scissors. The pumpkin is placed on a table, and the person is focused on cutting it carefully. The scissors are positioned towards the center of the pumpkin, with the person's hands holding the handles. The scene captures the process of preparing the pumpkin for a specific purpose, such as carving or decorating."}

OUTPUT: (0, "Since we have info that person is cutting a orange pumpkin and 'cutting a pumpkin' is one of the choices, we can make a reasonable answer selection. There are no other choices that are similar, since there is no mention of meat, cake, or watermelon. Even though the description mentions scissors instead of a knife, we take into account the possibility of noise in our descriptions, and scissors and knife look close enough in appearance, allowing us to make a reasonable guess that 0 is the answer.)

### Example 2
QUESTION: 'why does the thumb move upwards when the animal is moving close to it?'
CHOICES: "['feed dog', 'prevent from falling', 'hand gesture while talking', 'feel happy', 'draw attention']"
INFO: {'Time 10.4s/13.8s': "The image features a person holding a small, fluffy, gray animal, possibly a kitten or a rabbit, in their hands. The animal is resting comfortably in the person's palm, with its head tucked under their fingers. The person is holding the animal close to their body, providing a sense of warmth and care. The scene captures a tender moment between the person and the small creature.", 'Time 7s/13.8s': "Q - Is the person's thumb moving upwards when the animal is close, and if so, what is the person doing with their thumb? A - "Yes, the person's thumb is moving upwards when the animal is close. The person is holding the small kitten in their hand, and their thumb is positioned under the kitten's chin, providing support and comfort. This suggests that the person is gently holding the kitten and ensuring its safety and well-being."}

OUTPUT: (1, 'From the first description and the question answer pair it is reasonably assumed that the animal is in the person's hand and is small. There is no mention of feeding, and it is unlikely that the person is gesturing while talking with an animal in their hand. While the last two answers are plausible, the most likely answer is that the person is preventing the creature from falling since it is in the person's palm.")

Now, return your answer after OUTPUT. Remember return your answer as the index (zero-indexed) of the best answer.
