In the image, the girl is playing with a toy that resembles a keyboard, which is a musical instrument. The stick is likely an essential component of the toy, as it is used to play the instrument by striking the keys. By holding the stick, the girl is able to interact with the toy and engage in a fun and educational activity, learning how to play the keyboard and develop her musical skills."]
